My email to Justin:
Here we go.  
In Project2, they may be looking for an example of coding that shows more intimacy with the JSON and REST
These are new topics for me.  I solved the problem with a hack, and included links to examples that 
illustrate the proper use of JSON in C#.





Project 1
===========
Directions:
Create a class that, on instantiation, reads the attached file (test.txt) and stores only lines whose text can be converted to an Int32 data type. Convert all lines that meet this criteria to an Int32 and save in a data store of your choice. Then, implement the following methods in your class.

1. Create a method that returns a List<Int32> of all numbers in the data store.
2. Create an overload of method #1 that provides an ascending or descending sorted List<Int32> of all numbers based on an ascending/descending parameter.
3. Create a method that returns a List<Int32> of even numbers in the data store.
4. Create a method that returns a List<Int32> of odd numbers in the data store.
5. Create a method that returns a List<Int32> of numbers in the data store that are between 200 and 2000.
6. Create a method that returns a List<string> where a string is added for each number in the data store as follows:
- add "fizz" if the number is a multiple of 3
- add "buzz" if the number is a multiple of 5
- add "fizzbuzz" if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5
- add "none" if none of the above apply


Project 2
===========
Directions:
Write a simple program that uses GitHub's (https://github.com/) JSON API to take input of a
GitHub username and return the list of public repositories associated
with that username. Please use C#. You may use any toolkit or method you
desire to accomplish this. The program may be console or graphical.

Sample git hub users: sjuxax or danhakes

When finished, send a full archive of all code and resources necessary
to build your projects.


Project 2 is run as Main.
Project 1 can be exercized with the code in Project 2 with the removal of a return statement
